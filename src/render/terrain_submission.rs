//! Bounded command submission for native destination edits and their fences.
//!
//! wgpu-core 27.0.3 encodes each render pass plus its resource transitions in
//! separate HAL command buffers (`command/render.rs:1875,2262`). The pinned
//! Metal backend allows 4096 outstanding buffers (`metal/adapter.rs:30`) and
//! blocks when that pool is exhausted. Finishing a large unsubmitted frame can
//! therefore deadlock before the application reaches `Queue::submit`.
//!
//! Submit only at closed-pass boundaries. The same queue preserves order and
//! subsequent passes load the same attachments, so this does not change any
//! pixel, depth, object order or presentation boundary. See
//! <https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/issues/5738> and
//! <https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/7858> for the backend constraints.
